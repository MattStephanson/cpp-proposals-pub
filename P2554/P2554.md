# Description

## The Issue

Currently one cannot construct an `mdspan` from a multidimensional c-array.

```c++
int a[3][2] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
mdspan<int,dextents<2>> b(a,3,2); // fail
mdspan<int,extents<3,2>> c(a); // fail
```

It only works for 1D c-arrays, which decay to pointers.
However the deduction guide when using just the 1D c-array with no length argument,
would deduce a rank-0 `mdspan`, which may be surprising to users:

```c++
int a[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
mdspan b(a);
static_assert(decltype(b)::rank()==0);
```

## Proposal

We cannot currently fix the multidimensional c-array construction, since it is UB to alias a nested C-Array with a element type pointer - per discussion on the C++ committee reflector in January 2022.
However, in practice it works (on the compilers we tested e.g. clang-based and gcc) - and it may be something the committee changes in the future - i.e. make it not-UB. 
We propotyped this capability, which requires an additional constructor from c-array and a few deduction guides.

What we can fix today is the deduction from 1D c-array, by adding a deduction guide from c-array constraint to rank-1 arrays. 

This would enable the following:

```c++
{
  int a[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
  mdspan b(a);
  static_assert(decltype(b)::rank()==1);
  static_assert(decltype(b)::static_extent(0)==6);
}
```

It is currently possible, and will continue to be allowed to do the following with 1D c-arrays (via the decay to pointer code path):
```c++
{
  int a[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
  mdspan b(a,3);
  static_assert(decltype(b)::rank()==1);
  static_assert(decltype(b)::static_extent(0)==dynamic_extent;
  // b.extent(0)==3
}
{
  int a[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
  mdspan<int,extents<3>> b(a);
  static_assert(decltype(b)::rank()==1);
  static_assert(decltype(b)::static_extent(0)==3;
}
```

Adding this deduction guide now, means that if we later fix the general issue of constructing an mdspan from a nested c-array (which would require a core language change), we do not break prior behavior.

## Implementation Prototype

Based on the reference implementation of P0009 we implemented the changes in a godbolt example:
[godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/TWW8vbc5P).

# Wording

## In SubSection 22.7.X.1 [mdspan.mdspan.overview]


* Add the following deduction guides after the class definition:

```c++
template<class CArray>
mdspan(CArray&)
  -> mdspan<see below>;
```

```c++
template<class Pointer>
mdspan(Pointer&)
  -> mdspan<see below>;
```

## In SubSection 22.7.X.2 [mdspan.mdspan.cons]


* Insert after paragraph 19:

```c++
template<class CArray>
mdspan(CArray&)
  -> mdspan<see below>;
```
*Constraints:*

   * `is_array_v<CArray>` is `true`.
   * `rank_v<CArray>==1` is `true`.

*Remarks:*
   
   * The deduced type is: `mdspan< std::remove_all_extents_t<CArray>, extents<extent_v<CArray,0>> >`

```c++
template<class Pointer>
mdspan(Pointer&)
  -> mdspan<see below>;
```

*Constraints:*

   * `is_array_v<Pointer>` is `false`.
   
   * `is_pointer_v<Pointer>` is `true`.

*Remarks:*
   
   * The deduced type is: `mdspan< std::remove_pointer_t<Pointer>, extents<> >`

* Modify paragraph 20 to be:

*Constraints:* `(is_convertible_v<Integrals, size_type> && ...)` is `true` and `sizeof...(Integrals) > 0` is `true`.
